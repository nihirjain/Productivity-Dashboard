📊 Productivity Dashboard – Project Description

The Productivity Dashboard is a modern, user-friendly web application designed to help users plan, focus, and execute tasks efficiently from a single interface. The dashboard brings together essential productivity tools such as task planning, time management, and real-time environmental insights to improve daily workflow and focus.

The application features a clean and aesthetic UI with theme-based styling, smooth entry interactions, and an intuitive layout. A dedicated entry screen with swipe interaction enhances the user experience by guiding users into the dashboard while requesting location permission for better personalization.

Using geolocation, the dashboard fetches real-time weather data, helping users plan their day more effectively. Dynamic date and time updates ensure the dashboard always reflects the current context. The project focuses on performance, simplicity, and clarity, avoiding unnecessary animations after entry to maintain a distraction-free experience.

This project demonstrates strong skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, UI/UX design principles, DOM manipulation, API integration, and clean frontend architecture.
